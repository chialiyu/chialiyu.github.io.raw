I have been searching for a developer friendly way to blog for a while.  This site is setup using github page + Jekyll-now.  Although I stumbled upon some challenges when trying github automatic site generator (I didn't use it at the end - I don't like too much magic.), the whole setup can be completed in minutes.

Here are the steps:
1. Follow instructions on https://pages.github.com/.  Done criteria: See your site up and running at <your user name>.github.io

2. Find https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now.  Download  as zip.

3. Put the zip into the newly created <your user name>.github.io repo from step 1.

4. Update _config.md.

5. Push local repo to github.

6. To add new post - just add new md files under _post folder.

Done!
