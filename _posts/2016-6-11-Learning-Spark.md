Other than documentation from official Apache Spark, the websites below are good resources:

* [Jacek Laskowski's gitbook - Mastering Apache Spark](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jaceklaskowski/mastering-apache-spark/details)

* [NGUYEN Trong Khoa's blog](http://www.trongkhoanguyen.com/search/label/Apache%20Spark)
I found Jacek's gitbook here.  

More to come.
